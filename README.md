# mini-lathe

I got a 7-14" mini lathe for projects and home manufacturing. With this we can finally machine our own bushings, mounts, threads etc. 

Since this is a cheap Chinese lathe it needs some upgrades to make it usable but I'm certain we can make this a fun and informational video series while 

we use it for project builds too. This is the lathe I got:
